Our App provides the user with various options that will act as guidelines to lead a healthier life with Super-fit Me!

Module-wise Description:

Tkinter Library:
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined  with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter  provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
 Advantages of using Tkinter:
Tkinter is easy and fast to implement as compared to any other GUI toolkit.
  Tkinter is more flexible and stable.Tkinter provides three geometry managers: place,  pack, and grid. That is much more powerful and easy to use.

Time and Datetime Modules :

Python time module allows to work with time in Python. It allows functionality like getting the current time, pausing the Program from executing, etc. So before starting with this module we need to import it.

In Python,a module named datetime can be imported to work with the date as well as time. Python Datetime module comes built into Python, so there is no need to install it externally.Python Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually manipulating objects and not strings or timestamps. 
Message Box 
MessageBox Widget is used to display the message boxes in the python applications. This module is used to display a message using a number of functions.The tkinter.messagebox module provides a template base class as well as a variety of convenience methods for commonly used configurations. The message boxes are modal and will return a subset of (True, False, OK, None, Yes, No) based on the user’s selection.
Tk calendar:
Tkcalendar is a python module that provides the Calendar and DateEntry widgets for Tkinter. The DateEntry widget is similar to a Combobox, but the drop-down is not a list but a Calendar to select a date. Events can be displayed in the Calendar with custom colors and a tooltip displays the event list for a given day. tkcalendar is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
Pygame 
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games. It consists of computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.Pygame was officially written by Pete Shinners to replace PySDL.
Python Imaging Library
Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.The latest version of PIL is 1.1.7, was released in September 2009 and supports Python 1.5.2–2.7.Pillow offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:
per-pixel manipulations,
masking and transparency handling,
image filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding,
image enhancing, such as sharpening, adjusting brightness, contrast or color,
adding text to images and much more.
ImageTk Module
The ImageTk module contains support to create and modify Tkinter BitmapImage and PhotoImage objects from PIL images.The ImageTk module contains support to create and modify Tkinter BitmapImage and PhotoImage objects from PIL images and filedialog is used for the dialog box to appear when you are opening file from anywhere in your system or saving your file in a particular position or place.
 
 
OS Module
The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
os.system() method executes the command (a string) in a subshell. If a command generates any output, it is sent to the interpreter standard output stream. Whenever this method is used then the respective shell of the Operating system is opened and the command is executed on it.
Technology Selected and Technology features covered :
GUI Development
A graphical user interface builder (or GUI builder), also known as GUI designer, is a software development tool that simplifies the creation of GUIs by allowing the designer to arrange graphical control elements.
